# Test if your HTML matches GOV.UK Frontend

You can use our test fixtures to check you're outputting the same HTML that GOV.UK Frontend uses, when you:

- create your own component macros (also called ‘partials’ or ‘templates’)
- [update GOV.UK Frontend](/updating-with-npm/)

## Using the HTML test files

If you [installed GOV.UK Frontend with Node.js package manager (npm)](/installing-with-npm), you can find the `fixtures.json` file for each component in the `node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/components/COMPONENT-NAME/` folder, where `COMPONENT-NAME` is the name of the component.

For example, you can find the `fixtures.json` file for the button component in the `node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/components/button/` folder:

```js
{
  "component": "button",
  "fixtures": [
    {
      "name": "default",
      "options": {
        "text": "Save and continue"
      },
      "html": "<button class=\"govuk-button\" data-module=\"govuk-button\">\n  Save and continue\n</button>",
      "hidden": false
    },
    {
      "name": "secondary button",
      "options": {
        "text": "Find address",
        "classes": "govuk-button--secondary"
      },
      "html": "<button class=\"govuk-button govuk-button--secondary\" data-module=\"govuk-button\">\nFind address\n</button>",
      "hidden": false
    },
    // ...
  ]
}
```

Each object in the `fixtures` list is a different example of the component, where:

- `name` is the name of the example
- `options` are the options that generate this example's `html`
- `html` is the HTML that GOV.UK Frontend outputs with these options
- `hidden` is `true` if the fixture does not look or behave differently to the other fixtures provided

Do not include `hidden` fixtures when you use fixtures for manual or visual regression testing.

For each example, pass `options` into your own macro and check the generated HTML matches `html`.

If your HTML does not match exactly, you'll need to write your tests so they ignore known differences. For example your framework may add extra whitespace or attributes to your HTML.
