# Install with Node.js package manager (npm)

## Requirements

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

   GOV.UK Frontend requires Node.js version 12.17.0 or later to support ECMAScript modules. Where possible, we recommend you install the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version.

2. `cd` to the root of your project and check if you have a [`package.json` file](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json). If you do not have the file, create it by running:

   ```
   npm init
   ```

3. Install [Dart Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) - version 1.0.0 or higher.

   If you're using Dart Sass 1.33.0 or greater, you may see deprecation warnings when compiling your Sass. You can [silence deprecation warnings caused by dependencies](/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#silence-deprecation-warnings-from-dependencies-in-dart-sass) if required.

   Do not use either LibSass or Ruby Sass, which are deprecated, for new projects.

   Although GOV.UK Frontend currently supports LibSass (version 3.3.0 and above) and Ruby Sass (version 3.4.0 and above), we will remove support in future. If you're using either of these Sass compilers, you should [migrate to Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated#how-do-i-migrate) as soon as you reasonably can.

You can also [install Nunjucks v3.0.0 or later](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nunjucks) if you want to [use GOV.UK Frontend's Nunjucks macros](/use-nunjucks/).

## Install GOV.UK Frontend

Run:

```
npm install govuk-frontend --save
```

When the installation finishes, the `govuk-frontend` package will be in your `node_modules` folder.

You should now get started by [getting the CSS, assets and JavaScript working](/get-started/) with one GOV.UK Frontend component.
