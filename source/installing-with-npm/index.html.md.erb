# Install with Node.js package manager (npm)

## Requirements

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

    If you have not already installed version 4.2.0 or later of Node.js, install the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version.

2. `cd` to the root of your project and check if you have a [`package.json` file](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json). If you do not have the file, create it by running:

    ```
    npm init
    ```

3. Install [Dart Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) - version 1.0.0 or higher.

    If you're using Dart Sass 1.33.0 or greater, you may see deprecation warnings when compiling your Sass. You can [silence deprecation warnings caused by dependencies](/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#silence-deprecation-warnings-from-dependencies-in-dart-sass) if required.

    Do not use either LibSass or Ruby Sass, as GOV.UK Frontend does not support them. If you're using either of these deprecated Sass compilers, you should [migrate to Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated#how-do-i-migrate) as soon as possible.

You can also [install Nunjucks v3.0.0 or later](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nunjucks) if you want to [use GOV.UK Frontend's Nunjucks macros](/use-nunjucks/).

## Install GOV.UK Frontend

Run:

```
npm install govuk-frontend --save
```

When the installation finishes, the `govuk-frontend` package will be in your `node_modules` folder.

You should now get started by [getting the CSS, assets and JavaScript working](/get-started/) with one GOV.UK Frontend component.
