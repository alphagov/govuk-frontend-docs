# Import font and images assets

To use the font and image assets from GOV.UK Frontend, you can either:

- serve the assets from the GOV.UK Frontend assets folder - recommended
- copy the font and image files into your application

## Serve the assets from the GOV.UK Frontend assets folder - recommended

Set up your routing so requests for files in `<YOUR-SITE-URL>/assets` are served from `/node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets`.

For example if you're using [express.js](https://expressjs.com/), add the following to your `app.js` file:

```javascript
const path = require('path');
app.use('/assets', express.static(path.join(__dirname, '/node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets')))
```

## Copy the font and image files into your application

If you decide to copy the assets instead, copy the:

- `/node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets/images` folder to `<YOUR-APP>/assets/images`
- `/node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets/fonts` folder to `<YOUR-APP>/assets/fonts`
- `/node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets/manifest.json` file to `<YOUR-APP>/assets`

You should use an automated task or your build pipeline to copy the files, so your project folder stays up to date when we update GOV.UK Frontend.

### If you have your own folder structure

If you use a different folder structure than `<YOUR-APP>/assets/images` and `<YOUR-APP>/assets/fonts`, you can set Sass variables so that Sass builds the CSS to point to your folders.

Set one of the following before the `@import` line in your Sass file:

- `$govuk-assets-path`
- `$govuk-images-path` and `$govuk-fonts-path`

Set the `$govuk-assets-path` variable if your `font` and `image` folders have the same parent folder. For example:

```scss
$govuk-assets-path: "/<YOUR-ASSETS-FOLDER>/";
```

Set the `$govuk-images-path` and `$govuk-fonts-path` variables if your `font` and `image` folders have different parent folders. For example:

```scss
$govuk-images-path: "/<YOUR-IMAGES-FOLDER>/";
$govuk-fonts-path: "/<YOUR-FONTS-FOLDER>/";
```

You can also use your own function to generate paths, for example if you're using `asset-pipeline` in [sass-rails](https://github.com/rails/sass-rails). Set the `$govuk-image-url-function` and `$govuk-font-url-function` variables to the name of your function.
