# Migrate from our old frameworks

This page has been archived. From v5 onwards, GOV.UK Frontend is no longer compatible with GOV.UK Template, GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit or GOV.UK Elements.

If you need to migrate a service that uses GOV.UK Template, GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit or GOV.UK Elements to use the Design System, you should install GOV.UK Frontend v4 instead.

Follow the [guidance for migrating from our old frameworks](../v4/migrating-from-legacy-products/) in the v4.x documentation.
