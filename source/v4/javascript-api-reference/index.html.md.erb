# JavaScript API Reference

Some of our components can receive configuration options when you create an
instance in JavaScript. This page lists the available options for these
components. You can find further information on how to [configure these options
in our guidance](/configure-components-with-javascript/).

You can pass these options in an object either as:

- a second argument of the component's constructor
- the value for the key of the component name in an object passed to `initAll`

For example, to set the `preventDoubleClick` option of a button:

```javascript
// Creating a single instance
var button = document.querySelector('[data-module="button"]')
new GOVUKFrontend.Button(button, {preventDoubleClick: true})

// Or when using initAll
GOVUKFrontend.initAll({
  button: {
    preventDoubleClick: true
  }
})
```
