# GOV.UK Frontend (v4.x)

You should only install version 4 of GOV.UK Frontend if your service:

- currently uses GOV.UK Template, GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit or GOV.UK Elements
- needs to support Internet Explorer 11 or other earlier browsers

GOV.UK Frontend v4.10.0 and later versions include updated Header, Footer and Cookie banner components that use the refreshed brand.

Further brand changes and new components and features will only be available in v5 or later. Any further v4 releases will only include bug fixes.

Use this technical documentation to find out how to:

- [install the latest v4 release](../v4/installing-with-npm/) of GOV.UK Frontend
- [set up a test page](../v4/get-started/#get-started) to check your installation is working
- [migrate to GOV.UK Frontend](../v4/migrating-from-legacy-products/) from GOV.UK Template, GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit or GOV.UK Elements

Use the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) site to see live examples of GOV.UK Frontend components and guidance on how and when to use them in your service.

[Contact us](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-in-touch/) if you have any questions or feedback.
