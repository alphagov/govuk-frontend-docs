# Updating your service to use the new brand

In June 2025, GOV.UK started to refresh the brand across its products and services.

## If you’re using GOV.UK Frontend v6 or later

You do not need to take any action. Your service is using the refreshed GOV.UK branding.

## If you’re using GOV.UK Frontend v5 or earlier

We recommend upgrading to the latest version of GOV.UK Frontend as soon as possible to get the most up to date iteration of the GOV.UK brand.

Read our [guidance on staying up to date with changes on GOV.UK Frontend](../staying-up-to-date/) for ways and benefits of knowing when we release new versions of GOV.UK Frontend.

### If you cannot upgrade or are not using GOV.UK Frontend

Read the [GOV.UK Frontend v5 guidance on the brand refresh](/v5/brand-refresh-changes/).
