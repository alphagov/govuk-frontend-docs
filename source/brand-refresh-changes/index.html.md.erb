# Updating your service to use the new brand

In June 2025, GOV.UK started to refresh the brand across its products and services.

The changes affect these components:

- [GOV.UK header](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/)
- [GOV.UK footer](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/footer/)
- [Cookie banner](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/cookie-banner/)
- [Service navigation](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/service-navigation/)

## If you’re using GOV.UK Frontend v5

Update to the latest v5 release of GOV.UK Frontend. Follow the instructions in the [release notes for GOV.UK Frontend v5.10.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.10.0) to enable the new brand.
