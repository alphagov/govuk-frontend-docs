# Brand refresh changes to v4 and v5

We’ve added features from the latest version of GOV.UK Frontend to help more services implement GOV.UK’s refreshed brand. Ahead of the brand’s go-live date of 25 June 2025, you should prepare your service by updating its code. You’ll then need to deploy the changes to production on 25 June 2025 or as soon after this date as possible.

The changes affect these components:

- [GOV.UK header](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/)
- [GOV.UK footer](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/footer/)
- [Cookie banner](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/cookie-banner/)

We're supporting a refresh of the brand for both v4 and v5. See the [v4.10.0 release notes](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v4.10.0) and [v5.10.0 release notes](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.10.0) to see more details and how to update.
